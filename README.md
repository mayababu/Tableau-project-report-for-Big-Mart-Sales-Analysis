#Big Mart is experiencing uneven sales growth across product categories and outlet sizes. While core products like fruits, vegetables, and low-fat household items perform well, others like seafood, dairy, and regular breakfast items lag behind. Additionally, smaller Tier 2 outlets outperform larger outlets in sales per unit, suggesting potential issues with product assortment, resource allocation, and untapped revenue streams.
